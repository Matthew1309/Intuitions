This directory houses Matthew's experiment with humidity and temperature sensing. I initially constructed a model for the data as a first order linear ODE in `Modeling_evaporation.ipynb` and `Visualize_Sensor_Reading.ipynb`. I realized I couldn't understand how I derived the formula great from my documentation in these two files or even find the data (I have moved it to google docs under projects/incubator since). So I revisited the model, re-made it, and put a detailed documentation of it into `Visualize_Sensor_Reading2.ipynb`. The fits are the same, but this new model is much more interpretable and well documented.
