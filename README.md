# Purpose
As I develop intuitions for subjects, I would like to document them and hopefully help others out.

        * t-Test_gene_fits.ipynb: I would like to make a neural net that can fit negative binomial functions. Create as many sets of negative binomials as I need. Pad them. Maybe generate a set and make sure there are at least 10 of the same n,p that make it up, but differnt n_samples in order to teach the model how padding works. Have an internal variable length to fixed length encoder. Maybe have an LSTM? I really don't know if this is a time series problem. Output a regression that predicts the n,p. I can generate a ridiculous amount of this so I don't think data amount will be a problem, which means this is solvable >:)
