# Entry 1: Neural Networks
Motivation: I have been asked to explain neural networks to people that know nothing,
to very little about neural networks, and I feel I have come up short every time. I 
would like to fix that, and perhaps create a very good intuitive explaination for 
myself at the same time :)


Brainstorm:
* I have tried black box that takes an input and an output, that didn't seem to work
very well because it is abstract.
* I liked the real-life situation I had going on with sophia, I believe using a survey
to predict some category would be a very good intro to this topic. 
* Zia like the example of dog weight and cat weight to predict whether the animal we are
measuring is a dog or a cat.

# Entry 2: Neural Network Layers
Brainstorm:
* Layers are very tough to explain, but Sophia at least understood that they are transforming
the input data somehow into a usable form. I personally am going off of that video I saw where
space was morphed in linear, and non-linear ways until we ended up with two categories. It helps
that I have developed my own inutition of how linear algebra. 
* Each neuron in the layer recieves the same input, and each neuron is its own linear
equation. A layer of neurons is a stack of linear equations, whose answers will be the input for the
next layer, and so on.
* It may be useful to personify each neuron in isolation. (POOPY METAPHOR---->) Maybe use construction workers when a two
way street is made into a one way, and they wait to until enough cars have piled up one one side, and
there are no cars on the other to make a decision. They let you go if there is nobody on the other side.
If there are cars coming from the other side they stop you. If a lot of cars pile up on their side, the 
other construction worker will tell the other stream of cars to stop and let your side through?
* Better personification may be a chef on a gameshow, they are all given the same ingredients, and told
to make something. That something is generally different and unique, and that product then goes on to 
be taste tested by the judges, who ultimately give it a score. The above honestly sounds like a 
better explaination of the full neural net than the layers :(
* An assembly line of cake makers. Raw ingredients --> Shapeless mush --> Cake shape --> Frosting. Each
layer is able to make its own decision, for example if too much shapeless mush was passed to the "Cake
Shape" layer, it could make the decision to make a slightly bigger cake, or potentially split it into 
cupcakes. Then the "Frosting Layer" should be able to handle that.
