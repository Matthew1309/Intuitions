# Entry 1: Stat Quest t-Test
I would like to follow along with his example by using a real life 
example from GSE155882. This is a single cell dataset that has 4
conditions: control, TAC, TAC+JQ1, TAC+JQ1 withdrawn. Well I could make
a matrix of <br>


[200 most variable genes x 10 cells from each condition(40 cells)] + 
the associated meta data<br>


With this we can follow along with

better understanding of t-Tests!
