# Entry 1: Inuition via simple simple problem?
I thought of how to test out linear regression explaination. Two question survey
"are you a boy?" yes, no; and "do you like firetrucks?" yes, no; with the goal of figuring 
out if this person is a boy or a girl. Plot this where Q1 is X-axis, Y-axis is Q2, and color
by actual gender. How do we draw a line through this data to always classify girls from boys,
and how much variation is explained by each question. Is this a good mock problem?
