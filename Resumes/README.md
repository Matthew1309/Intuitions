These resumes were submitted to Tenaya for a potential summer internship position.
The program was called GROW, and it is for African American help.
First I have to note that all the resumes seem fairly bland and in the 
same format! It is like all these people used the same template to create it.
There is slight variation that I will get into, because some stuff worked
some stuff didn't.

## Stephany Cartney
I like the layout of her presentation. Bold titles and bullet point activities.
Not a lot of relevant experience at all, this is a young person. I see
nothing to indicate they are interested in biology, or have touched 
biological samples/tools.

# Okrah Susan
I don't like the font quite a bit. It is very spidery and hard to read.
They are getting a PhD which is impressive. Hmm very well qualified,
probably to work with Samantha on titer extraction? Crazy they are only
applying for an **internship**, this person should be looking for a job.
Despite being pretty impressive having that PhD title, their resume isn't
standing out to me...weird. Their most recent, and probably most exciting
experience they said is
> Developing an automated, high throughput method for respiratory virus testing and analysis.
Unfortunately this working just doesn't do this justice. I'm not sure
how I would personally spruce it up, but note: **Might need to paint
a better picture of my accomplishment than just one sentence**.

This is Karina's sister :3 how cute. Immediately the format is different,
which I personally enjoy. Incomplete sentences under the skills section,
didn't realize it would be so silly sounding.
> Effectively communicate such as listening...
I would make this into
I am an effective communicator. Very short and simple, but then maybe if
I have done a poster presentation, note that. Overall the *Skills* section
is a bit of a mess. 


Hmm in her *Education* section she lsits out some classes she has taken, but
I don't know if any of them were labs. Maybe highlight the ones that were
lab classes.

NOOO the *Experience* section is just so...weak! Her very first item 
seems so bland! I don't know what relevant stuff she did. It almost sounds
like they had her just filing papers! Also did she get her scholarship to fund
a project? What is a "sage grouse"? 

Waaaa, how would I fix this? I would definetely need to sit down and hear what
her jobs actually had her do, certainly we are burying what is important here.
